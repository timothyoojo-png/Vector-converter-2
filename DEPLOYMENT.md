## Manual Deployment Steps

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Git repository set up

### Build Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for production
npm run build

# Test locally (optional)
npm run start
```

### What Gets Generated
- `.next/` folder contains your built app
- Static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
- Optimized for production

## Environment Variables

No environment variables are required for basic functionality. The app works entirely client-side for file conversion.

## Custom Domain

After deployment:
1. Go to your hosting platform's domain settings
2. Add your custom domain
3. Update DNS records as instructed
4. Wait for propagation (can take 24-48 hours)

## Performance Tips

- The app is already optimized with Next.js
- Images are automatically optimized
- CSS is automatically minified
- JavaScript is automatically bundled and minified

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Build fails**: Check Node.js version (needs 18+)
2. **Dependencies missing**: Run `npm install` first
3. **Port conflicts**: Change port in package.json scripts

### Support:
